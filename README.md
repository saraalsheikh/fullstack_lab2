# Full Stack Lab 2

## Overview üìù

This repository contains a full stack web application, showcasing the integration of contemporary web technologies to build a dynamic system featuring:

*  **React Frontend:** Delivers an engaging and responsive user experience.
*  **Express.js Backend:** Manages server-side operations and API endpoints.
*  **MongoDB Atlas:** Provides a cloud-based solution for data storage and management.

The app models a real-world software architecture, emphasizing modular design, real-time data updates, and client-side rendering.

* **Data Visualization:** Presents project assignments along with employee and project information.
* **Automatic Updates:** Refreshes data every minute to ensure real-time accuracy.
* **Sortable Columns:** Allows users to sort table data by clicking on headers.

## Structure and Technologies üõ†Ô∏è

The codebase is divided into two primary sections:

* `client/`: Houses the React-based frontend.
* `server/`: Contains the Express.js backend logic.

Key technologies and tools include:

* **Vite:** Enables rapid React development and project bootstrapping. 
* **Nodemon:** Automatically restarts the server on code changes. 
* **Concurrently:** Facilitates running both frontend and backend servers together. 
* **MongoDB Atlas:** Handles cloud database operations. 
* **Mongoose:** Assists in modeling MongoDB schemas.
